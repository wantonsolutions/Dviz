    abstract = {Timestamping is a common method of totally ordering events in concurrent programs. However, for applications requiring access to the global state, a total ordering is inappropriate. This paper presents algorithms for timestamping events in both synchronous and asynchronous message-passing programs that allow for access to the partial ordering inherent in a parallel system. The algorithms do not hcnage the communications graph or require a central timestamp issuing authority.},

    abstract = {A distributed system can be characterized by the fact that the global state is distributed and that a common time base does not exist. However, the notion of time is an important concept in every day life of our decentralized "real world" and helps to solve problems like getting a consistent population census or determining the potential causality between events. We argue that a linearly ordered structure of time is not (always) adequate for distributed systems and propose a generalized non-standard model of time which consists of vectors of clocks. These clock-vectors are partially ordered and form a lattice. By using timestamps and a simple clock update mechanism the structure of causality is represented in an isomorphic way. The new model of time has a close analogy to Minkowski's relativistic spacetime and leads among others to an interesting characterization of the global state problem. Finally, we present a new algorithm to compute a consistent global snapshot of a distributed sy...},

@Inproceedings {Fay2011,
abstract     = {Fay is a flexible platform for the efficient collection, processing, and
                analysis of software execution traces. Fay provides dynamic tracing through use
                of runtime instrumentation and distributed aggregation within machines and across
                clusters. At the lowest level, Fay can be safely extended with new tracing
                primitives, including even untrusted, fully-optimized machine code, and Fay can
                be applied to running user-mode or kernel-mode software without compromising
                system stability. At the highest level, Fay provides a unified, declarative means
                of specifying what events to trace, as well as the aggregation, processing, and
                analysis of those events.</p>

                <p>We have implemented the Fay tracing platform for Windows and integrated it
                with two powerful, expressive systems for distributed programming. Our
                implementation is easy to use, can be applied to unmodified production systems,
                and provides primitives that allow the overhead of tracing to be greatly reduced,
                compared to previous dynamic tracing platforms. To show the generality of Fay
                tracing, we reimplement, in experiments, a range of tracing strategies and
                several custom mechanisms from existing tracing frameworks.</p>

                <p>Fay shows that modern techniques for high-level querying and data-parallel
                processing of disaggregated data streams are well suited to comprehensive
                monitoring of software execution in distributed systems. Revisiting a lesson from
                the late 1960’s [15], Fay also demonstrates the efficiency and extensibility
                benefits of using safe, statically-verified machine code as the basis for
                low-level execution tracing. Finally, Fay establishes that, by automatically
                deriving optimized query plans and code for safe extensions, the expressiveness
                and performance of high-level tracing queries can equal or even surpass that of
                specialized monitoring tools.</p>},
