\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Here we presented a our work parallelizing t-SNE for the sake of
interactive clustering, and a proposed architecture for JavaScript
applications requiring fast responses, and large scale computation. We
improved the interactivity of our clustering visualization by allowing
users to re weight variables based on importance, and by justifying
point distances by reporting per variable distances.  addition we
presented our technique for reducing large scale invariant data in our
traces by applying k-means to t-SNE output, and logically analyzing the
unique invariant behaviour of clusters.
