\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Here we presented a our work parallezizing t-SNE for the sake of
interactive clustering, and a proposed archetecture for JavaScript
applications requiring fast responses, and large scale computation. We
improved the interactiviy of our clustering visualization by allowing
users to reweight variables based on importance, and by justifing
point distances by reporting per variable distances.  addition we
presented our technique for reducing large scale invariant data in our
traces by appling k-means to t-SNE ouput, and logically analyzing the
unique invariant behaviour of clusters.
