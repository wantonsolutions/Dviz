%% Abstract section.

\abstract{Understanding and debugging distributed systems is a
difficult task. Without proper tools developers are forced to inspect
logs from diverse machines. Tracing tools are used track distributed
executions based on control flow, and are typically accompanied by a
visualization front end for ease of use, and comprehension. Here we
propose a visualization for state based tracing. Our prior work used
t-SNE to visually cluster an execution. This approach took minutes on
traces of over 100 trace points, and over 300 variables, a significant
barrier to interactivity. In addition we used inferred data invariants
as a characterization of a systems properties. Lists of such
invariants totalled in the hundreds, and were incomprehensible to
users. He we propose algorithmic, and architectural techniques for
improving the performance of t-SNE for the sake of interactivity, and
a novel technique for automatically extracting interesting data
invariants to reduce their cardinally, and increase
comprehensibility.}
