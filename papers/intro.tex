Developing distributed systems is a difficult task. Inherent concurrency,
non-determinism, complicate understanding how a system behaves. Developers
lack tool for providing insight about the state of a system during it's
execution.  The lack of insight makes triaging bugs an arduous task involving
the manual inspection of multiple logs. Visualization is useful for quickly
articulating information. Currently there are no tools which visualize the
state of a distributed systems to aid developers. Here we propose \dviz a tool
for visualizing the state of arbitrary distributed systems. \dviz profiles a
systems execution by capturing a systems state and rendering features of its
state transitions. \dviz produces predicable patters for systems executing
under normal conditions, and alternative patterns for unusual executions.
Developers can use irregularities in \dviz's output to quickly triage buggy
behaviour.
