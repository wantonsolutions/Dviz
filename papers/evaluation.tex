\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

To evaluate \dviz we will conduct a user study in which participants will use
\dviz to identify buggy distributed systems. The purpose of the study will be
to demonstrate that \dviz's output is useful for detecting buggy executions.
Participants will be shown multiple visualization generated from the executions
of three systems. To demonstrate \dviz's generality the system will be composed
of a cross section of popular distributed applications. Specifically the
systems will be etcd Raft~\cite{etcdraft}, Groupcache~\cite{groupcache} and
Hashicorp Swim~\cite{das2002swim}.  In all cases bugs will be introduced into the
systems and the buggy visualization will be displayed alongside the non-faulty
executions. Etcd Raft will be modified so that leader elections will result in
more than one leader.  Groupcache will not adhere to its key ownership policy.
Swim will not fully propagate event messages to it's cluster. Study participants
will be given a brief description of the systems and will be asked to select the
visualization which they suspect to be faulty. Upon selecting a visualization
participants will be asked to identify which aspects of the visual prompted
their choice.  Finally, they will be shown snippets of source code from the
buggy execution, and be asked to identify the block of code responsible for the
irregular visualization.
