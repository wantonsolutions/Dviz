\textbf{Distributed State}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{distributed snapshot}

The distribute snapshot algorithm proposes that consistent distributed state
can be captured without interfering with the execution of a system itself
~\cite{dist_snapshots_Chandy1985}. Distributed snapshots can be computed online
or mined from a log containing vector clocks which provide a partial ordering of events in a system~\cite{mattern_vector_clocks_1989}.

    \item \textbf{\dinv}

\dinv is a tool which detects likely data invariants in distributed
systems~\cite{dinv}. \dinv operates by instrumenting distributed systems to log
state and vector clocks. Execution logs from the nodes of the system are merged
together, and the state of the system is reconstructed and output as a
distributed system trace. \dinv leverages Daikon to automatically infer data
invariants on the trace.

    \item \textbf{state transition}

\textbf{Visualization for Distributed Systems}

Understanding distributed systems is a challenging task for system designers, 
software developers and students.  There are a few studies focusing on 
performance diagnositics of parallel or distributed systems, but few are done
to understand the distributed nature in terms of state machines: 
how distributed states transit.
Visualization is suitable when there is enough data but no automatic algorithms
to dig out the insights that people are looking for.  Here we can generate logs
that we need by \textbf{TODO}, and there does not exist a general model that 
can capture the distributed nature.
